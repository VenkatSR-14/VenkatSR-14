## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm **Venkat Srinivasa Raghavan**, an aspiring **Software Development Engineer (SDE)** and **Data Scientist** passionate about solving real-world problems with innovative solutions. Hereâ€™s a bit about me:  

---

### ðŸ”­ **What Iâ€™m Working On**  
- **CodeQuest**: A dynamic coding practice platform designed to enhance developer skills through real-time problem-solving and automated evaluation. Built with **Java microservices**, **PostgreSQL**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**, this project focuses on scalability, performance, and seamless user experience.  
- **CodeSage**: A project nearing completion, aimed at automating code reviews using **LLMs (Large Language Models)** like GPT and Mistral. Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, it provides real-time, actionable feedback during the development process. Built with **Python**, it incorporates advanced optimization techniques like **quantization** for efficiency.
